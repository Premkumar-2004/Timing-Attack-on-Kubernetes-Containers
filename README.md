# Timing Attacks on Kubernetes: An Exploration

## Overview

This project explores vulnerabilities in Kubernetes-deployed applications related to timing attacks, a subtle yet critical security threat. Timing attacks exploit small variations in application response times to infer sensitive information, such as authentication credentials, which could lead to serious security breaches.

The project emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect Kubernetes applications from timing-based exploits.

## Key Components

* **Vulnerable Application (app.py)**: Demonstrates timing attack vectors in a controlled environment.
* **Timing Attack Simulation Script (timing-attack.py)**: Analyzes response time variations to simulate real-world timing attacks.
* **Kubernetes Deployment & Service (YAML files)**: Used to deploy and expose the vulnerable application in a Kubernetes environment.

## Key Findings

* **Vulnerability**: Timing attacks can be leveraged to extract sensitive information from applications deployed on Kubernetes.
* **Mitigation**: Effective defenses include using constant-time algorithms, implementing rate-limiting, and introducing randomized delays to obscure response time differences.

## Deployment and Testing

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/timing-attacks-kubernetes.git
```

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t timing-attack-app .
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl apply -f timing-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f timing-service.yaml
```

### Simulate Timing Attack

```bash
python timing-attack.py
```

Observe how the script uses response time variations to infer sensitive information from the application.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the risks associated with timing attacks in Kubernetes environments and demonstrates the importance of adopting advanced security protocols to protect sensitive data.
